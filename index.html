          <h1 class="display-4">Stop Internet Censoring</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            <strong>We have seen many attempts to censor the Internet under the pretext of copyright protection.</strong>
            Notorious attempts are SOPA and PIPA of 2012, which triggered the largest online protest in history and was
            eventually withdrawn, and ACTA, a plurilateral trade deal killed by the
            European Parliament in 2012. Now, Korean government tries to enact a much stronger internet censoring rule.
            If it passes the legislative body, a copyright protection agency may cut off access to websites that the
            agency views as copyright infringing. The concerns over mass
            surveillance and privacy vulnerabilities by the proposed rule are widespread amid the government&apos;s new
            drive to block &quot;https&quot; traffic by SNI eavesdropping (See, press release of Korea Communication
            Commission on February 12, 2019 and press release of MCST on May 2, 2018, both in Korean).

        <section class="mb-5" id="bill">
          <h2 class="h2">Proposed Bill to Block File Sharing Websites</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            According to the proposed bill, the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) may order internet
            connection service providers, or ISPs, to block users&apos; access to foreign websites that allow
            unauthorised sharing of copyrighted materials (proposed Article 133bis (1)(iii)). Also, Korea Copyright
            Protection Agency (KCoPA), a governmental body, may recommend ISPs to take the blocking measure (proposed
            Article 133ter (1)(iv)). The bill, having passed the relevant committee in December 2017, is waiting for
            approval of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, the final hurdle before the plenary session. For
            timeline of the bill, see here.
            <br>
            <br>The censoring proposal is a move to strengthen the Korean three-strikes-out rule and implement the
            &quot;website shutting down&quot; obligation under the US-Korea FTA. Governmental measures to block, without
            any prior judicial scrutiny, access to foreign websites that host illegal information is not new. For
            several years from 1990s, the communication authorities have blocked and filtered contents deemed illegal
            and violating social norms, including those violating others&apos; copyright. But the proposed bill is new
            in that the copyright protection agency holds a power to block website access.
          </p>

        <section class="mb-5" id="rights">
          <h2 class="h2">Infringement of basic rights</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The bill is more harmful than SOPA and PIPA that provoked an internet blackout in January 2012 because the
            blocking can be implemented by an administrative decision without prior judicial review. Besides, the
            blocking is handled by a copyright protection agency whose mandate itself is biased in favor of interests of
            copyright industries rather than a balance striking between protection and dissemination of copyrighted
            works. Therefore, the proposed bill is very likely to violate the right to access, a citizen&apos;s
            fundamental right in digital environment, institutionalize internet censorship, and bring about a conflict
            with human rights such as freedom of expression and right to science and culture. <br>
            <br>The proposed blocking measure is not limited to websites that are hosting illegal &quot;copies&quot; of
            copyrighted materials. It also covers any information that can infringe any right protected under the
            Copyright Act, which may include hyperlink and search result. It further includes computer programs or
            information that may help circumvention of technological protection measures (TPMs).<br>
            <br>The U.N. special rapporteur in the field of cultural rights confirmed that website blocking measures to
            combat piracy &quot;could result in restrictions that are not compatible with the right to freedom of
            expression and the right to science and culture.&quot; (A/HRC/28/57, para 51)
          </p>

        <section class="mb-5" id="supporters">
          <h2 class="h2">Who Supports the Bill and Why?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Copyright holders, especially web-based cartoon creators vehemently support the bill. They are backed by
            copyright bureaus such as MCST and KCoPA who want to strengthen their own authorities. Webcomic writers have
            suffered from pirate sites such as &quot;Bam Tokki&quot;. Due to this suffering, they were captured by the
            myth that the bill would effectively address piracy problems by quickly blocking pirate sites, more
            specifically by shortening the time in making an administrative decision for blocking from two months to two
            weeks. <br>
            <br>But the rhetoric of &quot;two months v. two weeks&quot; is misleading. Under the current blocking rules
            and procedures, the communication authorities may make a decision in two weeks. In reality, the Korea
            Communication Standard Commission built up a task force to combat piracy and proclaimed that its examination
            on blocking would complete in four days.<br>
            <br>What the bill makes matters worse is skyrocketing of websites blocked by KCSC for the purpose of
            copyright protection. The bill provoked competition between administrative bodies in holding the blocking
            power. As shown in the chart below, after the bill passed the relevant standing committee of the National
            Assembly in December 2017 and the webcomic writers have crusaded to make the bill enacted, KCSC’s blocking
            decisions have tripled in 2018 (from 777 in 2017 to 2,338 in 2018). Further, KCSC tries to simplify the
            reporting and examination procedures for blocking decisions, implying a weakened procedural fairness.

        <section class="mb-5" id="lack">
          <h2 class="h2">Lack of Fairness and Legitimacy</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The copyright protection agency, i.e., KCoPA, is not a proper body to hold a power of website blocking as designed by the bill.
            <ul class="lof-list">
              <li class="mb-3">
                Firstly, KCoPA was established in 2016 by an amendment of the Copyright Act. Its mandate is to provide copyright
                protection services (Article 122-2 of the Copyright Act). The birth of KCoPA has a historical background. MCST had long
                provided financial support to Copyright Protection Center, a private organization and one of the main branches of the
                largest association of copyright industries. The tax money that MCST had provided for the copyright industries amounted
                KRW 29.9 billions for five years from 2011 to 2015. However, this huge financial support turned out to lack statutory
                grounds. One way the MCST to avoid this problem is making the private Copyright Protection Center into a public body.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Secondly, KCoPA violates the Copyright Act. The Act requires KCoPA to constitute its committee by keeping a balance
                between the number of members reflecting the interests of copyright holders and those reflecting the interests of users
                (Article 122-6 of the Copyright Act). Yet, the committee was not formed under this requirement, and KCoPA has no plan to
                change the committee construction before a three-years statutory term of office of the existing committee members.
