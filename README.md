# Stop-Internet-Censoring

South Korean government tries to enact an internet censoring rule. If it passes the legislative body, a copyright protection agency may cut off access to websites that the agency views as copyright infringing. The concerns over mass surveillance and privacy vulnerabilities by the proposed rule are widespread amid the government's new drive to block "https" traffic by SNI eavesdropping.

The bill is more harmful than SOPA and PIPA that provoked an Internet blackout in January 2012 because the blocking can be implemented by an administrative decision without prior judicial review. Besides, the blocking is handled by a copyright protection agency whose mandate itself is biased in favor of interests of copyright industries rather than a balance striking between protection and dissemination of copyrighted works. Therefore, the proposed bill is very likely to violate the right to access, a citizen's fundamental right in digital environment, institutionalize internet censorship, and bring about a conflict with human rights such as freedom of expression and right to science and culture. 

This website was made to oppose to this bill and let people know about this bill.
